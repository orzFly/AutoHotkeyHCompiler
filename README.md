New Life
--------
The original version was designed for AutoHotkey. It's good enough for it. 
However, after so many years of development, now here come AutoHotkey_L and
AutoHotkey_H.

Building the Compiler
---------------------
The original version was written in AutoHotkey Classic, so is my version. 
I am using 1.0.48.05, while it can be obtained [here] ( http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/86134-autohotkey-10-classic-and-basic-versions/?p=548675).
